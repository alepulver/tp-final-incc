Learn and predict book authors from words using supervised learning

# TODO

## Must

- some tests for classification.py
- experiment results, aggregation and CV
- update notebooks
- try interesting visualizations

## Ideas

- distribution vs contributions, from the same word/author matrix
- comparer for two feature sets, like entropies with different windows
- weighting windows
- stemming tokenizer
- add "collapsing" tokenizer, which converts unknown entries into the same fake token, instead of ignoring it like FilteringTokenizer
- look at exported items in namespaces, remove some and partition if needed
