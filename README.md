Learn and predict book authors from words using supervised learning

# TODO

## Must

- experiment results, aggregation and CV
- visualize experiment results, copy sklearn graphs
- update notebooks
- try interesting visualizations

## Ideas

- distribution vs contributions, from the same word/author matrix
- comparer for two feature sets, like entropies with different windows
- weighting windows
- finish transforming tokenizers (stemmer, lemmatizer, ...) and analysis helper
- look at exported items in namespaces, remove some and partition if needed
